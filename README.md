# Overview

I want to learn more about game development. The reason I chose Unity is that it is more suitable for beginner game developers. Also, instead of using C++, I feel more confortable of using C#. Therefore, I choose to learn Unity first.

This is a simple monster game. You need to kill the monster and touch the sign board on the right side of map.

Game Operation:
"A" and "D" to move the character left and right
"S" to move the character down
"J" to attack
"SPACE" to jump

The purpose to write this game is to build a personal project that fit my interest. And also help myself to get basic knowledge for game develpoment in Unity.
